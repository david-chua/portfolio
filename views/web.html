          <p class="web_paragraph_info"> <br><br>Inspired from using the gym and seeing people still using pen and pad to keep track of their progress, I decided to create a workout logging application that will keep track of a person's workout routine.
          <br>

          The Project was done with the following technologies: Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Node.JS, Express.JS, AngularJS, and HTML/CSS, & Bootstrap </p>

            <h1> The Challenges </h1>
            <p>As this was my final project for General Assembly, it did prove to be my most challenging one. The project only had four days to be completed and it involved creating everything from the backend including configuring models, relations, as well as routings and authentication as well as creating the frontend with AngularJS. It was also the only project since Month 1 where I worked on a project individually as General Assembly valued collaboration.
            <br>
            <br>
            While it was challenging, it did allow me to improve my time management and make decisions regarding the process or how my project would turn out. Having a Most Viable Product(MVP) checklist helped in that regard as I was able to cross out functionalities that I met and focus on finishing the rest of the project that I had remaining before going back and improving the project with the time remaining </p>

        The Project was done with the following technologies: Photoshop, Shopify, HTML/CSS, Plugins </p>

        <h1> The Challenges </h1>
        <p>This was my very first big freelance project. The process involved me actually being involved in doing a lot of fashion research. It helped that I was already working in retail at the time and already had years of experience in identifying the fashion trends.
        <br>
        <br>
        I think the biggest challenge for this project was the fact that social media takes a lot more into account; doing the work as an influencer took time and a lot more thought than I had imagined. Being able to constantly post in social media on a daily basis meant that I was on my phone regularly and was always in contact with other influencers that I was trying to work with. Creating instagram post meant formulating the right word, posting at the right time, and making sure that I am able to reach the maximum people.
        <br>
        <br>
        Facebook advertisements and Google Ads were another set of challenges. The advertisements had to be spent wisely and making sure that I am maximizing the ROIs meant that I had to choose the rights words to pay for and elminating those that failed to yield positive results. On top of that, I had to be able to identify which ads to run and which platform worked best.
        <br>
        <br>
        For Google Adwords, I had to make sure that I set my SEOs correctly and maximized their results and for Facebook, I needed to make sure that I reach the correct audience. It helped that Facebook had an ability to create suggestions and figure out what target size I would be hitting with my ads and that helped a lot.
