            <h1> The Challenges </h1>
            <p>As this was my final project for General Assembly, it did prove to be my most challenging one. The project only had four days to be completed and it involved creating everything from the backend including configuring models, relations, as well as routings and authentication as well as creating the frontend with AngularJS. It was also the only project since Month 1 where I worked on a project individually as General Assembly valued collaboration.
            <br>
            <br>
            While it was challenging, it did allow me to improve my time management and make decisions regarding the process or how my project would turn out. Having a Most Viable Product(MVP) checklist helped in that regard as I was able to cross out functionalities that I met and focus on finishing the rest of the project that I had remaining before going back and improving the project with the time remaining </p>

        <h1> The Challenges </h1>
        <p>This was my very first big freelance project. The process involved me actually being involved in doing a lot of fashion research. It helped that I was already working in retail at the time and already had years of experience in identifying the fashion trends.
        <br>
        <br>
        I think the biggest challenge for this project was the fact that social media takes a lot more into account; doing the work as an influencer took time and a lot more thought than I had imagined. Being able to constantly post in social media on a daily basis meant that I was on my phone regularly and was always in contact with other influencers that I was trying to work with. Creating instagram post meant formulating the right word, posting at the right time, and making sure that I am able to reach the maximum people.
        <br>
        <br>
        Facebook advertisements and Google Ads were another set of challenges. The advertisements had to be spent wisely and making sure that I am maximizing the ROIs meant that I had to choose the rights words to pay for and elminating those that failed to yield positive results. On top of that, I had to be able to identify which ads to run and which platform worked best.
        <br>
        <br>
        For Google Adwords, I had to make sure that I set my SEOs correctly and maximized their results and for Facebook, I needed to make sure that I reach the correct audience. It helped that Facebook had an ability to create suggestions and figure out what target size I would be hitting with my ads and that helped a lot.

      <div class="fashion_result">
        <h1> Results:</h1>
        <p> During the period I worked with EastC Fashion, I was able to bolster a 300% increase in revenue at the time. The Google Adwords and Facebook Ads didn't meet the expected revenue stream that the company were hoping for, but it was expected as starting the marketing campagins for those required more data and the company was able to capture a lot of useful data for marketing including what words to pay for in advertisement and the target audience that the company should be pursuing.
        <br>
        <br>
        On the other hand, the Instagram aspect were the most successful part of the campaign. The views we got using Google Analytics showed that the majority of our audience came from Instagram advetisements and a good percentage of the sales was due to the increase in the advertisement's click through rate (CTR).

        <h1> The Challenges </h1>
        <p> The biggest challenge for me in this project was understanding React. Even now, I think React is still the most confusing JavaScript library every but it's also one of the most popular ones so I'm still trying to learn it. I did take a lot of time away from learning React due to getting the Udacity Android Developer Scholarship.
        <br>
        <br>
        For this project, the main challenge was understanding how to pass state changes in the component. This challenge was hard for me because, I was not used to using JSX and at the time, I felt that mixing JavaScript and HTML/CSS was so wrong. It was only recently, after learning more React that it became clear to me that the HTML portion that I write in JSX is not really HTML, but rather a virtual DOM.

        <h1> Results:</h1>
        <p> While the project was successful, I did leave using React for a while. This means, that I will have to go through trying to understand it again; this time, a lot easier, as I have solidified some of the hard concepts that React offers.
        <br>
        <br>
        Going forward from, here, I have started taking various courses in React especially trying to understand the hood and hoping to start using it in a project that I've been looking forward to doing in the future.

        <h1> The Challenges </h1>
        <p> This was actually my third or fourth full CRUD app but it was the most finished in terms of having user authentication as well as having the full application running in Heroku. The challenge for this one was actually creating the design aspect. I wanted something simple and fun and a little on the childish side just because I wanted to create the app for little kids in order to create a book library of things they already read. I think it would be great to see how far the progression is when they see that they've read hundreds and hundreds of book if they decide to look back
        <br>
        <br>
        For this project, the main challenge for me was using AngularJS. During this time, I've only been creating Angular apps for about 3 weeks and during those times, we were also learning Ruby on Rails and understanding how to make the backend using Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL. For me, the hardest part was using directives at this point and knowing which directives I should be using.

      <p class="web_paragraph_info"> <br><br>My very first group project involving AngularJS and a full stack MEAN application. The app is a meal logging application meant to be use for weekly meal plans in order to move towards a healthy diet.
      <br>
      <br>
      The Project was done with the following technologies: MongoDB, AngularJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Wireframe.cc, Github </p>

      <h1> The Challenges </h1>
      <p> The main difficulty that I encountered in this project was the fact that we had to collaborate remotely. As this was the very first time that we were exposed to collaboration using Github, it was very difficult to keep track of how we should be working on each file; this led to a lot of merge problems as we were not able to communicate well enough of the changes that we made prior to working on specific files.
      <br>
      <br>
      We figured out a way around this problem by working in terms of pair programming. As it was a group of three, we had to specify which problems we want to work on and work from there. It actually shortened the programming work by a lot as we were able to give a lot of input as well as get feedbacks of the code we were trying to write and sometimes even get an easier input of what we should be writing.

      <h2> What's Cooking User Page</h2>
      <p> The user page is able to show a listed calendar of what meals would be prepared on a daily basis if a user logs it. Once a user clicks on a meal, it shows a full information using Angular directives. The user is then able to just view the full information or edit it if something changes.</p>

      <h1> Results:</h1>
      <p> The results of the project allowed us to learn about the various aspects of collaboration between developers and how version controls are very handy. It was a great experience to learn about how to best solve various problems that occurs when problems arise between developers in terms of a more technical aspects.
      <br>
      <br>
      On top of collaboration and version control, we also improved in reading code made by other people because we had to work with the code that was already created. This is similar to what real world jobs would be like since there is little to no chance that a program would be rewritten completey unless it is full of errors and broken code. We also improved in terms of pair programming in that we were able to work with others not by creating our code but also just by directing others and getting feedback at the same time while programming.

      <h1> The Challenges </h1>
      <p>This was my very first fullstack application. The main challenge aspect of this project was the idea of learning about MVCs in terms of development. During this portion of General Assembly, we focused on getting our CRUD to work without really going in depth about the design aspect.
      <br>
      <br>
      I managed to finish the application in that it is able to log in the fields I put in, but in terms of design, it was really elementary. I wanted to create something that were along the lines of a more professional app similar to those like Yelp and Facebook, but at four weeks into the program, my main focus was understanding how HTTP requests works as well as how I am able to complete the most viable product(MVP) for this project.

      <div class="web_paragraph_div">

        <p class="web_paragraph_info"> <br><br>One of the main aspects that I wanted to do was create a static page about the KBBQ dishes that's usually served in All You Can Eat(AYCE) restaurants. So I wanted to create a list of the variety of meats that someone would usually encounter while dining in an AYCE KBBQ restaurant. I think the page was done well in terms of providing the information, but in terms of design, I really want to continue improving it to be different in terms of providing a visually appealing design. </p>

        <p class="web_paragraph_info"> <br><br> This is the main user page where all the restaurants that a user has added is shown. It's different for every user as it should be. The design itself is lacking a lot, but its CRUD functionality is working. As I've mentioned in the challenges, I was really more focused on creating the functionalities that would get me to having an MVP.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="fashion_result clear">

      <h1> What's next?</h1>
      <p> The project was successful in terms of the full Create, Read, Update, and Delete was working in terms of the user's restaurant model. However, the design was extremely lacking. In terms of the next steps for this project, I'm thinking of different ways in which the design could be better. I used Handlebars.js in creating View of the project, I think I could do better by creating it in one of the more popular JavaScript frameworks like Angular or library like React. By doing so, I would be able to create a better UI and get more practice in terms of creating in the popular libraries.
      <br>
      <br>
      Beyond improving the UI, I also want to add various 3rd party APIs like Google maps or even Yelp's API to get information about the restaurant. It would be a great opportunity to get used to 3rd party APIs and improve on reading documentation on how to use other people's codes and how I can best use it.

      The project itself is unfinish, but is about 90%-95% in completion. I believe I only had the timer left before I am able to completely finish the project.
