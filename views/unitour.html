      <h4 class="h4_unitour"> My very first full research project in UX design, I went through the various steps of how an initial wireframe, mockup to prototype was done. Upon completion of this project, I have provided a high level prototype of what the user will go through in terms of logging in and the steps of how they would be adding colleges of their choice and eventually how they would be using the app to finally connect to a VR head gear to start a college tour. </h4>

    <h2> Research Process </h2>
    <h4> The research process for this project involved being able to identify the demographics of the audience that will be using this application. As it is a college tour app, I narrowed it down to two categories: the students and their parents. I felt that those two groups are the ones that will be the end user for the product even though it would most likely be used as subscription for high schools all over the country. However, as I felt tha the students will primarily be making the decision of which schools they'd like to visit, I ended up minimizing this project to focus solely on the student. Enter... Personas </h4>

      <h4 class="wireframe_info">To start with creating the prototype for the main application, I started with a hand drawn wireframe, which would be a rough sketch of what the application would look like.</h4>


      <h4 class="lowfi_info">Following the creation of the wireframe, I created a low fidelity example of the application, which would serve as a template to see how it would look like on a phone app. This would show whether a certain design works or not. Upon changes to the application, I then proceeded to create the hi-fidelity final prototype, which would be closer to what the actual app would look like. Following this, the final high fidelity prototype was created. </h4>

      <h2 class="wireframe"> Notes:</h2>
      <h4> Taking the time constraints in consideration, the final project is only done using a couple iterations of changes done to the main design. In a real world setting, user testing will be used in order to get feedback in all of the changes that would be done. In order to create the application that will provide the best user experience.
      <br>
      <br>
      Along with that, collaboration with project managers, and developers are a must as design and programming need to be aligned in order to create that great user experience. A great design with a bad program is equal to a bad design with a great program; neither will receive good feedback and both are not able to achieve their desired effect.
